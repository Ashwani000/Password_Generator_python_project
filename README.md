# Password_Generator_python_project
 Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its components:

1. Imports and Setup:
import random: This imports the random module, which is used to generate random selections.
print("*" *50): This prints a line of 50 asterisks (*), which serves as a separator for the output.
print("Here is your password Generator Application"): This prints the heading message indicating the password generator application.
2. Character Set for Password Generation:
chars = "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmQWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM,.;!@#$%^&*()?123456789": A string containing all characters (lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters) that can be used to generate passwords.
3. User Input:
number = input("Enter the number of passwords you want to generate:"): This prompts the user to input the number of passwords they want to generate.
number = int(number): This converts the user input (a string) into an integer value.
length = input("Enter the length of password:"): This asks the user for the length of each password.
length = int(length): This converts the length input into an integer.
4. Password Generation:
for pwd in range(number):: A loop runs for the number of passwords the user wants to generate.
passwords = "": Initializes an empty string for storing the password.
for c in range(length):: A nested loop runs for the number of characters the user wants in each password.
passwords += random.choice(chars): For each iteration, a random character is picked from the chars string and added to the password.
print(passwords): After each password is generated, it is printed out.
Summary:
This Python script generates multiple random passwords of specified length, based on the user's input. It uses a mix of letters (both lowercase and uppercase), numbers, and special characters to generate a secure password. The number of passwords and the length of each password are determined by user input.
